## Motivation and Goal

Cat is a very popular kind of pet around the world. They are so cute that it's hard for humans to resist their attraction. A cat can comfort and relieve people from the heavily burdened
modern fast-paced life and bring them a lot of fun.

But keeping a cat may take a lot of effort, energy and money, which is not affordable for everyone. For many young people living in rented apartments, it is even not allowed.

Meeting the need of these cat lovers who cannot keep a cat themselves, a new form of cat raising came into being in recent years -- **raising cat on cloud**. Cat lovers follow some cat
owners on social network, browsing images and videos of cats to satisfy their craving for cats.

To apply the concept of raising cat on cloud, I build this cat-themed social networking website called Meower. I hope this web application will bring all of you fun and joy.
